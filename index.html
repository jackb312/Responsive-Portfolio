         I'm Jack Brettell, and thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. 
         Coding and development is my second career, as I got into it after many years in 
         wine and spirits sales. My passion is helping my clients achieve what they want to 
         convey in web, mobile and gaming platforms. I have many years of experience and many 
         positive reviews of my work. Please navigate to the portfolio page to view some of the
         work I've done for my clients. All inquiries can be sent by email or by phone on the contact       
         page. Look forward to working with you soon!

         I'm originally from Kansas City. I graduated from Kansas State University in 2010 with a degree 
         in Political Philosophy. I moved to Seattle in 2016. I decided to make the transition to coding and development 
         because I wanted to learn a skillset that would be valuable for many years to come. Before embarking 
         in the transition, I did some self studying through codecademy, and discovered I enjoyed the challenge
         of working with code. In my spare time I enjoy running, climbing, 
         sailing, and exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
